### Main notebooks

* **1_exploreStatsBombData.ipynb**

The first lecture where we load the event data from **StasBomb's github** (https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data), we transform the json() files to more a more useful Pandas dataframe. We finish by extracting several metrics like shots and passes from all the event data.

* **2_ShotAndPassMaps.ipynb**

In the second lecture we will use the shots and passes we have extracted in the first lecture to create our own pass- and shots maps. More specific will we visualize how Yussuf Poulsen performed in the World Cup 2018. A tournament which is the highlight of Yussuf's international career and gave him confidence to lead and captain RB Leipzig to their great rise in the recent years.
